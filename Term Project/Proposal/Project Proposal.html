		<h3>What is your Website About?</h3>
		<p>I had an idea in my mind for a while now which was a twitter/Instagram based website dedicated solely for fashion. What it would do is create a constant stream of fashion content in which people can use some form of “Like” button. 
I also want to be able to make use of hashtags so that people can filter out outfits if they wanted to look for something specific. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
		<h3>What is the Objective of your Website?</h3>
		<p>Fashion is constantly changing and sometimes there are people who might catch on a bit slow. There are also people who might want to keep up to date or gain inspiration from others. The objective will be to create a community of people who has interest in fashion and allow them to share their own outfits with others. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
		<h3>Who is your Target Audience?</h3>
		<p>Target audience will mainly be people above 18+ who have even the slightest bit of interest in fashion. </p>
	</p>
	<p>
		<h3>What Content do you Plan to Include in Each Page of your Website</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Home &#8212 Where stream of contents from members of the community will be uploaded
</li>
			<li>Profile &#8212 Where a user can view their own profile and manage pictures they have uploaded and who they are following or being followed by. </li>
			<li>Account &#8212 Where user can manage privacy settings and link to other social media pages such as Facebook, twitter, </li>
			<li>Collection &#8212 List of top voted outfits for the season. Can be separated by regions since different weathers. </li>
			<li>News/Blogs &#8212 Conceptual, but if the website were to get big enough perhaps a blog or new about recent or current trends and infographics could be a thing. 
</li>
			<li>Styles &#8212 Shows all sorts of different clothing style and possibly sponsorship from clothing retailers. </li>
		</ul>
